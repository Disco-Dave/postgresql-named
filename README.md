# postgresql-named

Library for deserializing rows in `postgresql-simple` (or any other
library that uses `FromRow`) based on column names instead of the
positions of columns.

## Status

Currently, this is highly experimental and mostly to see if this is
possible at all. I might turn it into a decent library at some point
but for now I donâ€™t recommend to use it.
